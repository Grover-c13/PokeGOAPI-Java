:exclamation: This api is unstable as the backend pogo server are, so if you just want to use it, wait some days that we get stuff working great before complaining about the api isnt working ;) :exclamation:

# Build
  - Clone the repo and cd into the folder
  - `` git submodule init ``
  - `` git submodule update ``
  - verify that you have the jdk 8 in your path
  - `` mvn install ``
  - you should have the api bundled in ``target/pokemongo_api-jar-with-dependencies.jar``

# Usage
Mostly everything is accessed through the PokemonGo class in the api package.
The constructor of PokemonGo class requires a AuthInfo object which can be obtained from GoogleLogin().login or PTCLogin().login.

EG:
```java
AuthInfo auth = new GoogleLogin().login("token");           
PokemonGo go = new PokemonGo(auth);
System.out.println(go.getPlayerProfile());
```
