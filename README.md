Pokemon GO Java API

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Grover-c13/PokeGOAPI-Java.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Grover-c13/PokeGOAPI-Java)

See this guide for adding functionality:

:exclamation:

This API may seem unstable. This is because the backend Pokemon GO servers are unstable.

In case stuff is not working as expected, wait a moment to see if the problem resolves itself automatically.

You may also check the status of the servers on [IsPokemonGoDownOrNot.com](http://ispokemongodownornot.com) or [MMOServerStatus.com](http://www.mmoserverstatus.com/pokemon_go).

If you just want to use it, wait some days until the server issues are resolved (or if there is a problem with this library, you may fix it and send a PR this way).

# Build
  - Clone the repo and cd into the folder
  - `` git submodule update --init ``
  - verify that you have gradle in your path
  - `` gradle build bundle ``
  - you should have the api bundled in ``build/libs/PokeGOAPI-Java_bundle-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar``

  Confirmed working with Java 8 and Gradle 2.14.1  (Later versions of Gradle may work too) 

  PS : To eclipse user, you may build one time and add the generated java class for proto into eclipse path : Right click on the project > Build path > New Source Folder > Type 'build/generated/source/proto/main/java' > Finish

# Usage
Include the API as jar from your own build, or use Maven/Gradle/SBT/Leiningen: https://jitpack.io/#Grover-c13/PokeGOAPI-Java/master-SNAPSHOT

Mostly everything is accessed through the PokemonGo class in the API package.

The constructor of PokemonGo class requires a AuthInfo object which can be obtained from GoogleLogin().login or PTCLogin().login, and a OkHttpClient object.

EG:
```java
OkHttpClient httpClient = new OkHttpClient();
AuthInfo auth = new GoogleLogin(httpClient).login("token");           
PokemonGo go = new PokemonGo(auth,httpClient);
Log.v(go.getPlayerProfile());
```
##Android Dev FAQ

  - I can't use the sample code! It just throws a login exception!

You're running the sample code on the UI thread. Strict mode policy will throw an exception in that case and its being caught by the network client and treating it as a login failed exception. Run the sample code on a background thread in AsyncTask or RXJava and it will work.

  - I want to submit a refactor so that this library will use Google Volley

This library is meant to be a Java implementation of the API. Google Volley is specific to Android and should not be introduced in this library. However, if you still want to refactor it, you should create it as a separate project.
